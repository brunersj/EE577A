Schematic and layout design of an efficient general-purpose CPU that supports simple instructions such as Add, Bitwise operations, Store Word, and Load Word. A simple structure of the CPU contains Decoding Logic, Register File, Execution Units, Memory, and other surrounding circuitries. Our implementation included datapath optimizations to reduce area, internally forwarding register file to reduce NOP / datapath stalling, True Single-Phase Clock (TSPC) Flip-Flops to replace DFF resulting in a 16T area savings, dual-VDD for power reduction, and logical effort for combinational logic optimal sizing and delay.
